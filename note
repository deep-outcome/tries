- improve path generations (internal buffer)
- replace rev with double-ended iterator approach!
- iterator key
- clear
- acq mut
- extract + view
- readme samples in unit tests

- opts    
    ▪ reduce memory demands by raw pointers (fruitfull?)
    ▪ pseudo-root for all
    ▪ keys and values methods for tries
    ▪ view_mut methods

- reckoning
    ▪ crate with traits implemented by tries
    ▪ check with potential on extracting common code (ext, view, see res)

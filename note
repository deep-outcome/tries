- method:    
    - acq mut
    - extract + view
    - count

- opts        
    ▪ keys and values (complement to ext method)
    ▪ view_mut methods    
    ▪ clear returns count
    ▪ reduce memory demands by raw pointers (fruitfull?)    
    ▪ ext & view methods consumes capacity specifiers or put_trace_cap transforms to put_cap consuming enum denoting buff in question

- reckoning
    ▪ check with potential on extracting common code (ext, view, see res)
    ▪ fixed size (of node) lr-trie, two-languaged sides imply merged alphabet (=big node), one lang --> node is big by means of node size

- improve path generations (internal buffer)
- replace rev with double-ended iterator approach
- iterator key
- clear
- acq mut
- extract + view
- ct method
- readme samples in unit tests
- std::cell::UnsafeCell for all

- opts    
    ▪ reduce memory demands by raw pointers (fruitfull?)
    ▪ pseudo-root for all
    ▪ keys and values (complement to ext method)
    ▪ view_mut methods
    ▪ ext & view methods consumes capacity specifiers or put_trace_cap transforms to put_cap consuming enum denoting buff in question
    

- reckoning
    ▪ crate with traits implemented by tries
    ▪ check with potential on extracting common code (ext, view, see res)
